<h2>History</h2>
The area along the Danube River has been inhabited by varying cultures since ancient times.<br> 
The first large settlement dates back to the 5th century BCE; the inhabitants were Celts. <br> 
They called the town Ara Bona "Good altar", later contracted to Arrabona, a name which was used until the eighth century.<br>  
Its shortened form is still used as the German (Raab) and Slovak (Ráb) names of the city.<br> 
</p>
<p>
Roman merchants moved to Arrabona during the 1st century BCE. <br>
Around 10 CE, the Roman army occupied the northern part of Western Hungary, which they called Pannonia. <br>
Although the Roman Empire abandoned the area in the 4th century due to constant attacks by the tribes living to the east, the town remained inhabited.<br>

Around 500 the territory was settled by Slavs, in 547 by the Lombards, and in 568–c.<br> 
800 by the Avars, at that time under Frankish and Slavic influence. During this time it was called Rabba and later Raab.<br>
 Between 880 and 894, it was part of Great Moravia, and then briefly under East Frankish dominance.<br>

The Magyars occupied the town around 900 and fortified the abandoned Roman fortress. Stephen I, the first king of Hungary, founded an episcopate there.<br> 
The town received its Hungarian name Győr, which likely derives from Old Hungarian personal name Győr, who could be the county's first count.<br> [8] The town was affected by all the trials and tribulations of the history of Hungary: it was occupied by Mongols during the Mongol invasion (1241–1242) and then was destroyed by the Czech army in 1271.
